Instabond
=========

First of all, this demo was tested only on OSX.

- Requires that the user creates a folder in his documents folder named instagramDEMO, this name was used on mi demos and if
changed should be also updated on lines 51 and 52 of the Main.as file.
- Also requires the Print to Pogo.scpt applescript correctly setted up with the address of the polaroid pogo printer (http://marchawkins.com/blog/print-to-pogo-from-iphone-ipad-mac/)
